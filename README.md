Decentralized Autonomous Robotic Swarm with Reinforcement Learning

Project Overview:
Develop a swarm of autonomous robots that collaborate to achieve complex tasks in a decentralized manner. Each robot utilizes reinforcement learning to make decisions and improve performance over time. The swarm's coordination, communication, and data sharing are managed through a blockchain network to ensure security, transparency, and fault tolerance.
